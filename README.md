Explanation of my repo->
Website Overview:

This website is designed to cater to the needs of students, particularly those pursuing higher education. It offers three main sections, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. Lecture Notes Uploading/Downloading:

In the Lecture Notes section, users have the opportunity to access and contribute to  educational materials. Students can upload their lecture notes, making them available for others to download. While this functionality is in place, we acknowledge that there's room for improvement. We plan to enhance the note uploading process for a smoother user experience, implement features for better organization and categorization of notes, and ensure that uploaded notes are seamlessly displayed on the website for easy access.

2. Competitive Exam Resources:

The Competitive Exam Resources section is a valuable resource hub for students preparing for various competitive exams. We provide carefully curated links to useful study materials, practice tests, and reference resources. We continuously update and categorize these links to ensure they remain up-to-date and user-friendly, covering a wide range of subjects and exam types to aid students in their preparation.

3. Buy/Sell Section for Second-Hand Items:

Our Buy/Sell section is designed to facilitate student-to-student transactions for second-hand items. Currently, we have implemented the "buy" functionality, allowing users to explore and inquire about available items. However, we understand that the "sell" feature is not yet fully functional. In the future, we plan to enable users to list their items for sale, set prices, and provide contact information. Additionally, we'll implement search and filtering options for an improved shopping experience.

User Registration and Login:

To access these features, users are required to register or log in, ensuring a secure and personalized experience on our platform.
